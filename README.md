<b>### Hi there 👋<b/>

I'm a Frontend developer, designer, and community moderator, currently balancing my passion for coding with being a high school student. I’m deeply interested in development, moderation, and building thriving online communities.

🔧 I work on random projects during my free time, especially those involving Discord and creating tools for better user experiences.
